This repository contains a demonstration of the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology), originally introduced by Kermack and McKendrick in [1927](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118). The SIR model is a foundational framework in epidemiology, designed to analyze the spread of infectious diseases by categorizing the population into three compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).

The report is available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/sir/).
